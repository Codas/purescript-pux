# Getting Started

## Skeleton app

The easiest way to get started is to clone the
[boilerplate repository](https://github.com/alexmingoia/purescript-pux-boilerplate/),
which installs a skeleton Pux app, along with webpack and gulp tasks for hot
reloading.

```sh
git clone git://github.com/alexmingoia/purescript-pux-boilerplate.git example
cd example
npm install
```

This will install purescript, pulp, webpack, gulp.

Start the watch script and example app using `npm run watch`, and visit
`http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Pulp

If you're using pulp or bower, Pux is available as `purescript-pux`:

```sh
pulp dep i purescript-pux
```
